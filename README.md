# Grokking Algorithm

## Chapter 1 
**Recap**
- binary search is alot faster than simple search
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets alot faster once the list of items you're searching through grows
- Algorithm speed isn't measured in second 
- Algorithm times are measured in term of growth of an algorithm 
- Algorithm times are written in Big O notaino => EX:- O(n)

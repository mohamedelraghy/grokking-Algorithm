# Grokking Algorithm

## Chapter 1 
**Recap**
- binary search is alot faster than simple search
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets alot faster once the list of items you're searching through grows
- Algorithm speed isn't measured in second 
- Algorithm times are measured in term of growth of an algorithm 
- Algorithm times are written in Big O notaino => EX:- O(n)

## chapter 2
**Recap**
- your computer's memory is like a giant set of drawers
- when you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a list 
- whit array, all your elements are stored right next to each other
- with a list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one.
- Arrays allow fast read
- Lined list allow fast insert and deletes.
- All elements in the array should be the same type (all ints, all doubles, and so on)
